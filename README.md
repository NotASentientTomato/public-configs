# About
Monium_dark is a color scheme made to oppose the usual color spilling in desktop environments. 
It's main values is that colors should be 
1) Conspicuous: Colors are used to make ui elements visible by having it pop out from the proximal contents. Therefore, colors are primarily used as boxes such as text background, rather than coloring text and other thin ui elements where the color is hard to scan for.
2) Unambiguous: Color retains its meaning in any context it is used through the desktop environment.
